# Access For All

This app was created by Debbie, Ivana, Jack, Slava and Istvan who took part in the Code Institute hackathon in September 2021.  The theme was to create an app for employers to use to increase inclusivity and accessibility for all employees.  In line with this theme we decided to create an app for an interviewer to use which gave them the facility to record their scores  and notes from a group of questions for each applicant and also helped them see how candidates were ranked.  Onboarding information would also be provided so that candidates queries about onboarding should they be successful at interview could be answered quickly.

## 1. User Experience design
### 1.1 Strategy Plane
Stakeholders of the website:

#### 1.1.1 Goals and Objectives of Stakeholders (users)
|User|Goals, Needs, Objectives|
|----|------------------------|

### 1.2 Scope plane

### 1.3 User Stories
* As a ... I want to ..., so I can ...

### 1.4 Structure plane

### 1.5 Skeleton plane

### 1.6 Surface plane

## 2. Code design
* utilizing the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) framework for handling REST API calls
  - The `run.py` file contains code related to Flask only, no database or form reference can appear in there.
  - The `db.py` file is a module and contains code related to the database.
* generating web pages from HTML templates with [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating inserts
  - the `base.html` file contains the base HTML structure of all web pages generated in the app
  - the `index.html` extends the `base.html` into the Home page

### Deployment in development environment

#### 7.0 Python and Git
Make sure, that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) are installed on your computer

### 7.1 Set up the MongoDB-Atlas hosted database

* Sign up for a free account on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* create a new organisation and a new project
* inside the project at Database Deployments, create a new cluster
  * choose Shared / free tier cloud provider and region / M0 tier / choose cluster name
* inside the newly created cluster create a database, e.g. `access4all`
* in Deployment Security / Database Access, create a user with password authentication, select role `readWriteAnyDatabase`

Note down the following details:
- cluster name
- database name
- database username and password

#### 7.2 Clone the project's GitHub repository

1. Locate the repository here https://github.com/ruszkipista/access4all
2. Click the 'Code' dropdown above the file list
3. Copy the URL for the repository (https://github.com/ruszkipista/access4all.git)
4. Open a terminal on your computer
5. Change the current working directory to the one where the cloned folder will be located
6. Clone the repo onto your machine with the following terminal command
```
git clone https://github.com/ruszkipista/access4all.git
```

#### 7.3 Create local files for environment variables
Change working directory to the cloned folder and start your code editor
```
cd access4all
code .
```
Create file `envWS.py` with the following content into the root of the project folder
```
import os
os.environ.setdefault("FLASK_SECRET_KEY", "<secret key>")
os.environ.setdefault("FLASK_IP",         "127.0.0.1")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT",             "5500")
os.environ.setdefault("FLASK_DEBUG",      "True")
```
The `<secret key>` can be any random character string from your keyboard.

Create file `envDB.py` into the root of the project folder with the following content:
```
import os
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_CLUSTER",    "<cluster name>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB_NAME",    "<database name>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB_USER",    "<user name>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB_PASS",    "<password>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_INIT",       "True")
```
Take `<cluster name>`, `<username>`, `<password>` from the MongoDB creation item at 7.1
 
#### 7.4 Set up the Python environment
In your development environment, upgrade `pip` if needed
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```
Install `virtualenv`:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:
```
virtualenv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 7.5 Start the web server:
```
python app.py
```

### Deployment on Heroku
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a PaaS cloud service, you can deploy this project for free on it.

#### 7.6 Prerequisites:
- you forked or copied this project into your repository on GitHub.
- Heroku requires these files to deploy successfully, they are both in the root folder of the project:
- `requirements.txt`
- `Procfile`
- you already have a Heroku account, or you need to register one.

#### 7.7 Create a Heroku App
Follow these steps to deploy the app from GitHub to Heroku:
- In Heroku, Create New App, give it a platform-unique name, choose region, click on `Create App` button
- On the app/Deployment page select GitHub as Deployment method, underneath click on `Connect GitHub` button
- In the GitHub authorization popup window login into GitHub with your GitHub username and click on `Authorize Heroku` button
- Type in your repo name and click `search`. It lists your repos. Choose the one and click on `connect` next to it.
- either enable automatic deployment on every push to the chosen branch or stick to manual deployment
- go to app/Settings page, click on `Reveal Config Vars` and enter the following variables and their values from the `envWS.py` and `envDB` files:
  * FLASK_SECRET_KEY
  * MONGO_CLUSTER
  * MONGO_DB_NAME
  * MONGO_DB_PASS
  * MONGO_DB_USER
