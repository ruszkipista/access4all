<h1>Onboarding process</h1>
<h2>Diversity and Inclusiveness<h2>

<p>We are specialised in inclusive onboarding processes. Our main goal is increasing diversity at work place and creating mentorship programs which
     help companies embrace difference. When companies administer and uphold the precepts of diversity within an organization, it creates a more enriched 
     environment that fosters employee growth, innovation and productivity.
</p>
<p>Workplace is “the collective mixture of differences and similarities that include individual and organizational characteristics, values, beliefs,
     experiences, backgrounds, preferences and behaviors.” It’s appreciating the whole person for the traits and talents that set them apart from one another. 
</p>
<p>In parallel with diversity, an inclusive work ecosystem offers unbiased and respectful treatment, regardless of the environment. Inclusion celebrates the 
    things that make all of us different, like age, gender, religion, education, etc. and how these differences offer empowerment and connection. Employees 
    are treated fairly across the board and open to the same opportunities, tools and resources. With widely accepted social mores and office standards as its
    foundation, inclusion is the act of making an “outsider” feel accepted.
</p>
<p>All of our hiring managers, interviewers and recruiters have been trained to understand and counteract their unconscious and conscious biases.
   Our hiring process and use techniques are fair (inclusive language in job ads, blind CV reviews, and standardized questions and scoring in interviews).
</p>
